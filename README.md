# Fetch Rewards Take Home for Senior Analytics Engineering Role

## Description

This is my submission of a take-home assignment for a senior analytics engineering position at [Fetch Rewards](https://fetch.com/).

## How to Run

I've used a [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebook to hold the questions, my thoughts, and code inline. You can launch this in a dev environment using either the provided `Dockerfile` as a devcontainer or creating a virtual environment with the provided `requirements.txt` file by typing `marimo edit investigate_and_create_tables.py`. Given that marimo notebooks are also just flat python files, you could also review just the python file - but you wouldn't get the niceties of inline result or markdown. I'd also turn off autorun on start-up given that the notebook is written with the idea that it'll be reviewed in order.

Thanks for reviewing!
